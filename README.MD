### Oh, Hello there ðŸ˜Ž

I have experience with AWS, Node, MySQL, DynamoDB, Heroku, YAML, and Typescript.

I am currently working on the backend of an application for Evenhand Group Inc. It will offer businesses a means to provide a personalized learning experience for its employees.

The next step that I am taking with my personal projects will be to move Bid To Win to AWS, and explore using WebSocket to allow for remote PvP games.
